# Web Visualization Dashboard

 Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

In building this dashboard, I have created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.


Website Requirements

For reference, see the "Screenshots" section below.

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:


A landing page containing:


An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page.


Four visualization pages, each with:


A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:


Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.


A "Data" page that:


Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table must be a bootstrap table component.
The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation here





The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu.
